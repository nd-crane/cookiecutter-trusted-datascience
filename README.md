# Cookiecutter for Trusted Datascience

[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template to start trusted data science projects. Project uses [drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) as a starting point for creating project structure but updates the tools to a more modern python stack that adds support to use [dvc](https://dvc.org) for data versioning and [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) for python package and dependency management.
